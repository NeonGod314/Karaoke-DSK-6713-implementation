# Karaoke-DSK-6713-implementation
Implementation of Karaoke on DSK6713 chip using the concepts of Signal Processing

I've implemented a Karaoke application on TI DSK6713 DSP chip using C language. For Hardware implementation input 
to the DSK is given from the laptop using aux cable onto the LINE_IN pin of DSK and the output has only the instrumental sounds, 
and no vocals. The output is taken from earphones attached to the DSK LINE_OUT pin

I've also uploaded the simulation code for the same application. It's there in the folder MATLAB sim
